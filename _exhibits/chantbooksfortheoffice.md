An antiphoner (or antiphonary or antiphonal) contains the sung parts of the Divine Office that are specific to Sundays, feasts, and the Common of Saints. The chants found in an antiphonal include the antiphons sung with the psalms and canticles, the responsories of Matins and Vespers, and sometimes the hymns. Antiphoners were divided into two sections, the first encompassing the Proper of Time or the temporale (beginning with the first Sunday of Advent), and the second organized around the Proper of Saints or the sanctorale.

The large-format antiphoners of the later Middle Ages contain the chants
for only part of the church year, however. Designed for several singers
to view at the same time, these choirbooks were typically produced in
sets of multiple volumes. The full photography of a fifteenth-century
Benedictine choirbook from Perugia (Columbia, Rare Book and Manuscript
Library, MS Plimpton 041) is available in Columbia University Library's [Digital Library Collections](https://dlc.library.columbia.edu/catalog/ldpd:113554). For a
complete inventory of the chants in the manuscript consult the [Cantus
database](https://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/source/589026).

Such manuscripts may contain the feasts of saints special to certain
religious orders; for instance, the feasts of Saint Francis are found in
a Franciscan antiphoner of the fourteenth century, possibly copied in
Siena (Barnard College Library, MS 1), available in the DLC
[here](https://dlc.library.columbia.edu/catalog/cul:v6wwpzgpwg). All the
chants in the manuscript are listed in the Cantus database.

Hymns can appear in an antiphoner or breviary at their place within each service, but they were also often copied together in an independent collection called a hymnary, which can be a separate book or a section of a book for the Office (often a psalter).
