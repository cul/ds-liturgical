# COLLECTION SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Wax leverages Jekyll collections for much of its
# functionality, therefor some of the keys below are from
# Jekyll while others are Wax-specific.
# For more info, refer to:
# ~> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/

collections:
  exhibits:
    output: true
  # qatar: # name of collection
  #   output: true # makes sure pages are output as html files
  #   layout: 'qatar_item' # the layout for the pages to use
  #   metadata:
  #     source: 'qatar.csv' # path to the metadata file within `_data`
  #   images:
  #     source: 'raw_images/qatar' # path to the directory of images within `_data`

  liturgical:
    output: true
    layout: 'liturgical_item'
    metadata:
      source: 'liturgical.csv'

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# LUNR SEARCH INDEX SETTINGS
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# You can create multiple lunr indexes below (though only one is
# recommended!) by specifying
# a `file` to write it to and some `collections` for it to index
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:lunr` .
# You can optionally generate a default UI by specifying a UI file
# and running `$ bundle exec rake wax:lunr UI=true`.

lunr_index:
  - file: 'search-index.json' # file the index will get written to
    ui:   'js/search-ui.js' # path to the search UI file
    collections:
      liturgical:
        content: false # whether or not to index page content
        fields: # the metadata fields to index
