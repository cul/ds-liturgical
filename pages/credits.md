This site is based on the web exhibit “Celebrating the Liturgy’s Books” (2002), originally produced by Consuelo Dutschke and Susan Boynton, in collaboration with the Columbia University Libraries. 

The current version was edited by Susan Boynton and John Thomas Glasenapp in collaboration with [Digital Scholarship at Columbia University Libraries](https://library.columbia.edu/services/digital-scholarship.html). The pages were built by Alex Gil using [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/), the minimal computing toolset designed by [Marii Nyröp](http://marii.info/).

Special thanks to the Beinecke Library for their permission to use a reproduction of The Olivetan Gradual (Beinecke MS 1184) as our site banner.
